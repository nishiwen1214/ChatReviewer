Trifolium repens Linn., known as white clover, is a typical legume perennial herb with a wide distribution worldwide. In June 2023, a leaf chlorosis and root rot disease accompanied by brown vascular bundle discoloration was observed on T. repens plants in the forage and lawn-grass germplasm resources field, of Sanping Farm of Xinjiang Agricultural University (Xinjiang, China). Root rot symptoms could be observed in the three fields investigated, and the incidence rate was 22 to 36 %. Five plants with leaf yellowing and root rot symptoms were randomly collected from each field for pathogen isolation.
